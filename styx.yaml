# List first the packages that you edit locally and want compiled "all the time", by cabal:
local-packages:
  my-main-package: chargen
    location: .    # location on your disk
  #my-local-dep:    # package name
    #location: dep  # location on your disk

# Optional: list patched or cutting edge packages that you depend on.
# These will be compiled only once, by nix.
#source-deps:
  #mtl:
    #location: https://github.com/mrawesome/awsm-patched-version-of-mtl.git

# If you want you can add other haskell nix packages to depend on.
# Normally this is not necessary, because nix will track the dependencies on its own.
# Thus this section is mostly useful for throw-away projects which do not have a cabal file.
#nix-deps:
    #- criterion
    #- gasp
    #- lens
    #- statistics

# In case you depend on other non-haskell tools or libs.
#non-haskell-deps:
    #- z3

# Optionally, one can ask for a specific version of nixpkgs:
#nixpkgs:
  #commit: 8ef3eaeb4e531929ec29a880cb4c67f790e5eb70
#  sha256: 4d2fae900d2d99ea294f4f412289af77152ac21d7b2e9ff23581ef11ea00831f
  # or like this: url: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-channels/archive/nixos-14.12.tar.gz

# Optionally, one can ask for a specific version of ghc known by nixpkgs
